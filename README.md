# Spit Bawlin

Being a student of a full-time Full Stack Coding Bootcamp can be overwhelming. Everything feels new, exciting, and strange. The resources are endless. Spit Bawlin' is developed as a personalized user 'bulletin board' that's a one-stop shop for coding bootcamp students. Features include the ability to write and save notes, where to lookup nearby coffee shops to study/work on coursework, and a resources feature to store links and other useful information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project is built with:

Axios, Classnames, Grommet, JWT Decode, Polished, React, React-DOM, 

React-Router-DOM, React Scripts, and Styled Components.

### Dependencies

Spit Bawlin uses the following depdencies:

bcryptjs, body-parser, bulma, concurrently, express, is-empty, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, nodemon, passport, passport-jwt, react-google-maps, validator.

## Technologies Used

This application uses the following technologies:

React and React Router for the front end.
Express and Node for the back end.
MongoDB for the database.
Bulma for CSS styling.


## Deployment

This project is hosted by the Heroku platform.

## Future Development

Further development of our Coffee component--we are working to make it more interactive. Our hope is to add a search function as well as displaying location information when hovering over pins. We want to develop a more complex resources modal displaying a preview of stored links, a drag and drop option for user notes, ability to update previously posted notes, and integrating an interactive glossary for users to quickly search for key terms. We also envision fluid interactions between users--ability to share notes, resources, links, etc. between individual profiles.

## Challenges

A significant challenge for us is linking our client-side user input from the dashboard page to our backend server with MongoDB. Eventually we hope to have these pieces communicating in order to retrieve user-generated notes links, etc. However, the user authentication is a success.

## Acknowledgments

Spit Bawlin was built (with permission from our course instructor) using code from a MERN Stack Template that can be found here: [Github Repo](https://github.com/bcbrian/mern-template). Text-effect for the Coffee components were used from Google Fonts. The Google Map component was built following a YouTube tutorial by user Leigh Halliday, which can be found here: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf7g32CwX_s). Assistance from our course instructor, TAs, and troubleshooting tips found on Stack Overflow were also invaluable resources for us.
